# Week 1 - Basic Web Development

Develop a web site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  The web site should consist of three webpages.

- `index.html`  This is the welcome page to your website. It should contain a heading, a welcome message and an image.
- `about.html`This page contains information about you.  It should include headings, paragraphs, a list and an image.
- `rating.html` This page contains a form that allows a user to submit a rating for for something **other than course ratings** (books, movies, restaurants, video games,  etc.). It should should contain a heading, a paragraph containing instructions and a form with at least three UI componets and a button to submit the rating.  

## Important Notes

- All files (html, css, javascript) are placed in `website` folder in this repository.
- All CSS should be placed in a separate file and all html files should use the same CSS file for styling.
- Pressing the button on the rating form writes the contents of the form controls to the console.
- Use appropriate input widgets for all required user input and a button or buttons to execute the JavaScript function performs a calculation and outputs the results.

When you've completed the assignment, commit and push your solution to GitHub.  Be sure that you have moved to the repository directory using `cd directory-name` before you issue these commands.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "completed javascript assignment"
git push
```

### Grading

This assignment will needed to be submitted in two place.  Here in GitHub by pushing the final version of your code and in [Blackboard](https://lewisuniversity.blackboard.com), by submitting the related assignment.

This assignment is due in Week 1 (Sunday by 11:59PM CST).  There will be a 5% per day reduction in grade for late assignments.  Late assignments will be accepted for up to one week.

### Academic Honesty

If you copy any part of your assignment from another student, from an online source including a generative AI bot, or from someone who took the course a previous semester, you will receive zero points for the assignment and any future academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the class.
